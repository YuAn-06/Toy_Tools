# Toy_Tools
*Some tools for time series data*

* **`FFT.py`:** **Toy code of Fast Fourier Transform for time series data and corresponding visualizations. The shape of data is **\[N,D\]**, N, D represents the number of data and dimension.**

* **`auto_correlation.py`:** **Toy code to test autocorrelation, stationary and variable correlation for time series data and corresponding visualizations. The shape of data is **\[N,D\]**, N, D represents the number of data and dimension.**

*  **`Postional Embedding visualization.py`:** Toy code for the visualization of Postional Embedding.
